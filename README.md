# PHP-Scripts
This repository contains several single PHP scripts I created. I will keep adding a few more in the upcoming weeks.

1. A menu-based network script I wrote for my Hardware/Software Co-Design class (CECS561) at Cal State Long Beach.
2. A middleware API for the Infoblox WAPI in PHP using CURL. This API can be easily called by any PHP files in order to implement a web frontend for interacting with Infoblox devices.
